This is the code repository for [Mastering Concurrency in Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-concurrency-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789343052), published by Packt.

**Create faster programs using concurrency, asynchronous, multithreading, and parallel programming**

## What is this book about?
Python is one of the most popular programming languages out there, with numerous libraries and frameworks that facilitate high-performance computing. While concurrency and parallelism in Python behave differently than those in other programming languages, it is still in every way possible to implement Python programs that run concurrently or in parallel and make a significant improvement in execution time. Mastering Concurrency in Python serves as a comprehensive introduction to various advanced concepts in concurrent engineering and programming.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the idea of concurrency in programming and relevant concepts such as queues, threads, parallelism. 
* Explore the core syntax and language features that enable concurrency in simple Python problems, namely through concurrent, multiprocessing, asyncio. 
* Understand correct way to implement concurrency  
* Abstract methods to keep the data consistent and application non-blocking, responsive, and reliable. 
* Analyze problems commonly faced in concurrent programming. 
Utilize application scaffolding to design highly scalable programs that are deeply rooted in goroutines and channels.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
async def main(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        await download_html(session, url)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you're a developer familiar who's and you Python who want to learn to build high-performance applications that scale by leveraging single-core, multi-core, or distributed concurrency, then this book is for you.
